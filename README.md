## 1. Description
**Amphora Health's hk_model**: A Biomedical ML Pipeline. Our `hk_model` effortlessly evaluates trained biomedical machine learning models against new patient datasets. Discover a curated collection of pre-trained models in our `models` folder, ready for diverse medical data analysis applications.

## 2. Installation

### Folder Structure
Organized and intuitive, the `hk_model` project structure is as follows:


    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ engineering/
	â”œâ”€â”€ env/
	â”œâ”€â”€ models/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
    
    
This structure ensures a seamless navigation and operation of the pipeline.

### Prerequisites
To set up `hk_model`, ensure all prerequisites are met. Refer to our `requirements.txt` for a comprehensive list of necessary dependencies. This file provides all you need to prepare your environment for using `hk_model`.


## 3. Usage
To run this **hk_model** Pipeline, you will need to be in the top level folder and then execute the following command to be run in Unix (Mac):

```bash
make run_model FILE=fileNameIn MODEL=modelName
```

#### Parameters Explained
Understand each parameter for a successful execution:

| Parameter | Argument         | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `FILE`    | `<input_file_name>` | Name of the input file located in `data/raw/`. This file should contain new instances for prediction. |
| `MODEL`   | `<model_name>`   | Name of the pre-trained model for predictions, found in `src/models/`. |

### Examples

To run the pipeline with one sample file:
```bash
make run_model FILE=hk_sample.csv MODEL=gaussian_e112.pkl
```
