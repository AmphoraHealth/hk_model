This project uses Docker to manage its environment and dependencies, ensuring consistency across different systems. Follow the steps below to build and run the project using Docker.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.


## 3. Build the Docker Image
To run this **hk_model** Pipeline, you will need to be in the top level folder and then build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t diabetia:v1.0 .
```
## 4. Running the Docker container
After building the image, you can start the container using the following command:

```bash
FILE=hk_sample.csv MODEL=gaussian_e112.pkl docker compose up inference
```

#### Parameters Explained
Understand each parameter for a successful execution:

| Parameter | Argument         | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `FILE`    | `<input_file_name>` | Name of the input file located in `data/raw/`. This file should contain new instances for prediction. |
| `MODEL`   | `<model_name>`   | Name of the pre-trained model for predictions, found in `src/models/`. |
